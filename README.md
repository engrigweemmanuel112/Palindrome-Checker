 Project Overview:
 
The Palindrome Checker is a simple yet interactive web tool that allows users to check if a given input is a palindrome. It provides instant feedback and demonstrates key front-end concepts such as real-time input handling, string manipulation, and dynamic rendering.

💡 Key Features:
🔄 Real-Time Feedback: As users type, they immediately see whether their input is a palindrome.

🎨 Clean, Responsive UI: Designed with a minimalist layout to ensure readability and ease of use on all devices.

🧠 Case-Insensitive & Space-Insensitive: The checker intelligently ignores punctuation, spaces, and letter case.

💬 User-Friendly Messages: Clear prompts guide users and explain results in simple language.


Learning Outcomes:
While building this project, I deepened my understanding of:

Real-time DOM updates

String handling and regular expressions in JavaScript

Creating interactive and accessible user interfaces
